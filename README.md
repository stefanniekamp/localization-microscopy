Here, we are assuming that the channels (channel 1 and 2) are registered and that no drift is accruing. Many parameters can be changed as listed below and the file can be 'dragged and dropped' into the mManager 'Data' window in the 'Localization Microscopy' plug-in for analysis. Files will be saved in the same folder the script is in.A Gaussian distribution is applied to the true position of channel 1 and 2 based on the variance in the fluorophores localization of the respective channel. Moreover a Gamma distribution is applied to the underlying distribution of the variance in the fluorophores localization for channel 1 and 2.In this script you can change the values for the expected distance (mu), for the standard deviation in fluorophores localization of channel 1 and 2 (sigmaloc1 and sigmaloc2) as well as the underlying distribution of the standard deviation in fluorophores localization of channel 1 and 2 (sigmasigmaloc1 and sigmasigmaloc2). Moreover, the number of spot pairs of channel 1 and channel 2 (numberofspots) as well as the number of frames / number of observations of each molecule (frames) can be set. In addition, a standard deviation for heterogeneous samples (mustd) can be chosen. Finally, you can decide how many data sets with a particular parameter set (numberofrepeats) you like to generate. You also have the option to simulate multiple combinations of parameters as once. For instance, if you select two different distances, it will carry out all simulations for the other parameters for both distances.Note: Values that are not needed for distance prediction in mManager (e.g. intensity, background, ...) are set to 1.We also provide two example output files:
